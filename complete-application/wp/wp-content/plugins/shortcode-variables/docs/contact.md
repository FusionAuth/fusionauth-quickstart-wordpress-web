If you wish to contact YeKen or have an issue with Snippet Shortcodes, please use the following methods to get in touch.  
  
## Issues > WordPress.org forum
  
Ideally, if you have a technical issue, I'd prefer you to ask for help on the plugin's WordPress.org forum. That way, solving your problem publicly may help others if they come across the same issue. You may find the answer to your problem is already there.
