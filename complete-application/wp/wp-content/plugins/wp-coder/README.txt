WP Coder gives you the freedom to incorporate diverse elements, constructed using scripts and styles, into virtually any part of your website.

For instance, introducing a pop-up window script or a notifications script to a webpage is effortless, eliminating the need for multiple plugins, thereby avoiding the potential for site performance degradation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I activate WP Coder in Network mode? =

If you're using WordPress in Network mode, WP Coder will need to be activated for each individual site within the network. Unfortunately, the plugin does not support network-wide activation at this time.

= Where can I find more detailed documentation? =
You can find a complete guide and detailed usage instructions in our [official documentation](https://wow-estore.com/guides/wp-coder/).

= Can I insert any shortcode into the HTML block content? =

Absolutely, you can embed any shortcode into the HTML block content using WP Coder. This flexibility not only allows you to include shortcodes from other plugins, but you can also use shortcodes specifically from WP Coder itself, adding a layer of convenience to your customization process.

= How can I use the tag feature in the 'Publish' block? =

Tags in WP Coder are useful for categorizing and grouping your code snippets. When you create an item (a code snippet), you have the option to assign a tag to it in the 'Publish' block. This tag can help you organize your snippets and make them easier to filter in the list of items. To assign a tag, simply enter the name of your tag in the 'Tag' field when creating or editing an item.

= How do I use the link feature in the 'Publish' block? =

The link feature in the 'Publish' block allows you to attach a link to the page where your shortcode is inserted. This way, you can always track where you've placed a particular shortcode. You can set this by entering the URL of the page in the 'Link' field when creating or editing your code snippet in WP Coder.
